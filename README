trotter.py is a little script which grabs Daytrotter sessions for you.
(it now also grabs mp3s from any music blog RSS feed you've hard-coded into it)

It relies on a couple of non-built-in libraries you'll probably have to install.
It's not too complicated a process, so bear with me - if you are a person who is
new to the command line, I'll hold your hand; if you are a person who knows
their way around a UNIX environment, you can do this in your sleep.

1. Download and install setuptools from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#downloads .
        I recommend grabbing the "Source" .tar.gz file, which should be on top.
        Unzip it. Then,
        * If you're on a mac:
            i. Bring up Spotlight and type in Terminal, then select the Terminal program.
        * If you're on Windows:
            i. Bring up the command line (hit Start, then Run, then type "cmd" and hit enter) (by the way if you don't have python installed you should probably take care of that)
        * If you're on Linux:
            i. Bring up a friggin' terminal, you know how to do this stuff.
            
        Now then:
            ii. In the Terminal, use the "cd" command to change directories so you end
                up in the same place you unzipped the setuptools package.
                ( http://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucd.htm might help if you have trouble. )
            iii. Once you're finally there, type "python setup.py install" and hit enter.
                You should see a bunch of relatively encouraging text, and it should now be installed.
                
2. Download and install feedparser from http://code.google.com/p/feedparser/downloads/list
    Unzip it, follow the same directions as above to get to the folder and run "python setup.py install".
    
3. Download and install python-dateutil from
    http://labix.org/python-dateutil#head-2f49784d6b27bae60cde1cff6a535663cf87497b .
    Unzip it, follow the same directions from 1) to get to the folder and run "python setup.py install".
    
4. Okay! Now you're all set and ready to grab sessions. Bring up a command line, navigate to the place where
    you put the trotter.py script (you'll probably want it to be somewhere relatively permanent, like
    C:\trotter or ~/trotter), and run "python trotter.py --help". That should walk you through the rest.
    
5. Enjoy sweet, sweet music.
    

TODO: separate the hard-coded list of URLs out into a separate file, allow for addition/removal of feeds to parse via command-line options
